This repository contatins all the relevant code of the "Animal Images Classification" project that is submitted as a final project report in the course "Practical Topics in Machine Learning".

Each file is an independent file which runs on its own:

**cnn_model.py** - Relatively simple CNN model.

**data_augmentation_model.py** - CNN model which uses some data augmentation techniques.

**data_visualizations.py** - The code for creating all the plots that are presented in the final project report.

**improved_cnn_model.py** - Model that is an improvement of the relatively simple CNN model.

**transfer_learning_model.py** - Transfer learning model based on ImageNet with data augmentation.
